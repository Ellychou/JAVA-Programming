    //then discuss the ambiguity in the problem description, and
    //reword it to remove the ambiguity in the space provided below.

    //Ambiguity:
    //1. Is "dog" case-sensitive? In the following code, we assume yes, and we do not count "Dog".
    //2. Should we count the word which contains "dog", such as "hotdogs", "dog-like"? We also assume yes as we count "dog-like" and "hotdogs"
    //
    //I will reword the problem as"Count the number of times the word dog in some input text. 
    //The word dog is case-sensitive, so do not count the dog with any Capital character such as "Dog" or "dOg". 
    //But count the word which contains "dog"."
    //

      //if "dog" could not be found, it will return -1. I have add "index+3" as parameter, so if it finds a "dog"ï¼Œ next time it will search the substring which is after this "dog".
